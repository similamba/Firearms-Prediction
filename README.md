# Rule mining of firearms incidents

In this project, we have performed rule mining & cluster analysis of incidents involving firearms in the USA. The incidents are recorded from 2013-2018.  

The dataset has been sourced from Kaggle.

To learn more about the incidents, K-Means was performed & 2 clusters were analyzed to get common patters. Furthermore, using association rule mining, additional rules were explored.
